# ‚è≥ It's time to change things. 

MShade is a project aimed at creating a new ecosystem to enhance your approach to creating Minecraft servers. The entire Minecraft server part has been redesigned and rethought to fit our goals.

# ‚ôü Key features

- Enderchest is a new Minecraft server that does not depend on any protocol. It is somewhat of a universal definition and each protocol can be grafted onto Enderchest to create a link with the client.
- World management has also been rethought by implementing segmentation to no longer have any chunk limits.
- The cross-language part allows developers of different languages to work together while still retaining the power of their respective language. This means that a single plugin can be used on multiple servers, as if it were a BungeeCord plugin. Furthermore, plugin updates no longer require server restarts, as plugins are isolated.

---------------

We are convinced that MShade offers many possibilities for improving the Minecraft server creation experience and we hope you will be interested in this project. Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or if you would like to know more.
